This is my first Python Project that I am posting on Github.
The project name is Sorting House Hogwarts.
In this project I am using if else function of pyhton.
Basically I am asking some questions and on the basis of your answer you will get allotted to a house( which can be Gryffindor,Slytherin,Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw.) from the Harry Potter series.
You guys can make any changes to make this program more easy or fun to use. :)
